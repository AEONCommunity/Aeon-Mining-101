## Aeon mining on Other Operating Systems (Example Ethos or Simpleminer or Other operating systems)

* Ethos: Since Ethos is a linux package build, You can either sudo compile any ubuntu miner of your choice or use their pre-installed
packages for their supported miners. Using their supported packages usually includes a dev fee which you can compile out yourself. It
is always recommended to donate freely to the miner devs if you compile out this dev-fee since they are the ones that make the miners
that you are using. Compiling instructions are listed on your miners GitHub account. 

* [Android mining Monero with minergate app](https://youtu.be/iHdO7EWpTwg) Please note that as of 11/1/2018 the Minergate mobile mining
app was removed from google play store. You can not mine via their app anymore but still use it to check your miners on your phone. One 
could possibly compile rooted on an Android device with their 18.04 Ubuntu miner if possible.
